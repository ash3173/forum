# Comunity-Forum application using NodeJS and socket.io library.

This sub-project is a vital segment of our overall solution crafted for the Smart India Hackathon 2023, focused on developing a chat assistant for PGRKAMâ€”an employment service initiative by the Punjab state government. Notably, our chat assistant is implemented using LLM (Large Language Model) technology. This sub-application facilitates real-time messaging through the integration of the socket.io library. Additionally, the forum feature enhances user support by enabling community interactions, allowing individuals to collaborate and address any uncertainties they may encounter.
